	<h1>A bit about me, and the things I do (or have done)</h1>

  <h2> Story so far </h2>
	<p><p>I began my career as a software engineer at <a href="https://www.cognizant.com/us/en" target="_blank">Cognizant</a>, specializing in full-stack tech, while working on projects of various scales in the financial domain. 
    During this time, I moved to Belgium and started working on-site for KBC bank as a front-end developer. </p>
  
  <p> After two years of work experience, I decided to pivot my career and started pursuing a Masters in Artificial Intelligence at <a href="https://www.kuleuven.be/kuleuven" target="_blank">KU Leuven</a>, specializing in Big Data Programming. 
    My master’s thesis was focused on developing a billings and settlements system for car-sharing in a completely decentralized fashion. This is what got me into the field of blockchains.</p>
  
  <p>In the summer of 2018, I successfully defended my <a href="https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/cosic/publications/thesis-313.pdf">master’s thesis</a>,
  and decided to pursue a Ph.D., supervised by Prof. <a href="https://homes.esat.kuleuven.be/~preneel/" target="_blank">Bart Preneel</a>, focusing on a blend between Cryptography and Blockchains at <a href="https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/cosic/" target="_blank">COSIC</a>, KU Leuven. I chose COSIC because of its reputation as a world-class group in the field of cryptography and the good experience I had while being supervised by COSIC researchers.</p>
  
  <p>In the winter of 2022, I decided to combine by Ph.D. with a full-time job (yes, I am that crazy), and accepted <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PT_KR28AAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Tomer Ashur's</a> offer to join him at <a href="https://www.3milabs.tech" target="_blank">3MI Labs</a>.</p>
  
  <p>In the spring of 2024 I successfuly defended my <a href="https://kuleuven.limo.libis.be/discovery/search?query=any,contains,LIRIAS4158026&tab=LIRIAS&search_scope=lirias_profile&vid=32KUL_KUL:Lirias&offset=0" target="_blank">PhD thesis</a>, and subsequently got promoted to the CTO position at 3MI Labs.</p>
